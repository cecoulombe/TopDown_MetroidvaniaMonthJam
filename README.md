# Metroidvania Month Game Jam

This project was created as a top down video game template which will later be used for the Metroidvania Month 23 game jam, hosted on itch.io. I am intending to create a generic template for multiple different types of games for various game jams until I find a type that resonates with me to use for my own project.

## Getting Started

Once completed, the game will be released for free on itch.io where it can be played in browser or downloaded on to Apple or Microsoft products.

### Prerequisites

Unity 2022.3.12f1
or the appropriate game for your operating system downloaded from itch.io when completed.
